## 💖 Our Contributing Philosophy

### Guiding Principles
1. **Open & Transparent:** All work happens in the open. We discuss features and bugs in GitHub Issues
2. **Developer-First:** We strive to make the codebase clean, modern, and easy to understand
3. **Community-Driven:** The best ideas can come from anywhere. We listen to all suggestions and value every contributor

### Types of Contributions We Welcome
- **💻 Code Contributions:** Help us build new features, fix bugs, or refactor code to be more efficient
- **🎨 UI/UX Improvements:** Have an eye for design? Help us make the frontend dashboard more intuitive and beautiful
- **✍️ Documentation:** Good docs are crucial! Help us improve READMEs, add tutorials, or clarify technical details
- **🐞 Bug Reports:** Find a problem? A well-documented bug report is an invaluable contribution
- **💡 Feature Ideas:** Have a great idea for a new feature? Open an issue and let's discuss it!

---

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

You'll need these tools installed on your machine:

1. **Git:** [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. **Docker & Docker Compose:** [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Local Development Environment

We've made this as simple as possible using Docker. You don't need to install Python, Node, or PostgreSQL on your machine.

#### Setup Steps

1. **Fork the repository:**
   Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of the repository page

2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Voice-Marketing-Agent.git
   cd Voice-Marketing-Agent
   ```
   *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username)*

3. **Create a new branch:**
   Always work on a new branch, never on `main`. Use descriptive names:
   ```bash
   # For a new feature:
   git checkout -b feature/add-call-analytics
   
   # For a bug fix:
   git checkout -b fix/resolve-tts-latency-bug
   ```

4. **Launch the application:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```
   - The `--build` flag rebuilds images if you've changed code
   - The `-d` flag runs it in the background

5. **Download the LLM (one-time setup):**
   ```bash
   # Get the exact container name by running 'docker ps'
   docker exec -it voice-marketing-agent-ollama-1 ollama pull tinylama
   ```

6. **Verify your setup:**
   - **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
   - **Backend API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/docs
   
   If both pages load, your environment is ready!
